## Project Overview

This project aims to identify top candidates for interview selection using machine learning and data analysis. The dataset consists of partially incomplete applicant records and past performance scores.

### Task Summary

- **Data Exploration:** Clean and analyze a corrupted dataset containing candidate attributes and performance scores.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build a model to predict candidate scores and select the top candidates for interview (e.g., top 100).
    - Document model choice, validation methods, and evaluation metrics.
- **Visualization:** Create at least one data visualization to communicate insights.
- **Presentation:** Summarize findings and methodology in a short presentation.

*All work completed in Python, with emphasis on practical data science workflows and interpretability.*
